## SYNOPSIS

restart-tor-gui

## DESCRIPTION

restar-to-gui is a graphical tool for restarting Tor. It shows the
tor bootstrap sequence in a progress bar. It closes itself two seconds
after tor bootstrap has completed.

Error catching is implemented after the restart command. In case of error,
it displays the output of the "sudo systemctl restart tor@default" command
in a message box.

restart-tor-gui is produced independently from the Tor anonymity
software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality,
suitability or anything else.
